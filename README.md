#### Why is semiconductor packaging needed?
- When dies/chips come out of the wafer, they are made in a protected environment, but ICs are exposed to the real world. So packaging:
  1. Enables the die to connect to other dies
  2. Protection of semiconductor devices (Corrosion, moisture, and physical damage)
<br> </br>
#### IC Manufacturing Flow:
1. Design – Circuit & layout design
2. Wafer Process – Fabrication of ICs on wafers
3. Package & Test
    - Wafer Test – Test individual dies on wafer
    - Package – Encapsulation of dies
    - Package Test – Test packaged ICs
4. Assembly – Final integration into products

Types of Manufacturers:

- IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer) – Handles design, fabrication, packaging, and testing in-house
- OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Test) – Specializes in packaging and testing only
- Fabless – Only designs ICs; fabrication outsourced
- Foundry – Only fabricates ICs for other companies
